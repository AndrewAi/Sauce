Repo for an ionic to-list app as part of a project i have to do for college

Sauce is the name of the Ionic list app that I required to create as part of my college course.

The app has a simple design.
in the header of the app there is a text box, which allows you to input your task.
then click on the plus button to add the task to the list.

there is 3 different tabs in the one for short term tasks another for medium term task,
and one for long term tasks.

you can also swipe left on any task to delete it.
